Workflow for Automated Databases Comparison and Reporting System
User Authentication and Database Connection

User Login: Users authenticate themselves using a secure login system.
Database Selection: Users select the databases they want to compare (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle).
Connection Setup: Establish connections to the selected databases using appropriate drivers and credentials.
Schema Extraction

Automatic Schema Retrieval: Extract table schemas from the connected databases automatically.
Schema Storage: Store the extracted schemas temporarily for comparison.
Comparison Algorithm Execution

Custom Comparison Algorithm: Implement a custom algorithm to compare table structures and data.
Structure Comparison: Identify differences in table structures (e.g., columns, data types).
Data Comparison: Detect discrepancies in data using hashing and indexing techniques.
Record Identification: Identify missing, modified, or mismatched records.
Discrepancy Detection and Analysis

Discrepancy Logging: Log all detected discrepancies for further analysis.
Performance Optimization: Optimize the comparison process for performance using efficient algorithms and data structures.
Visualization and Reporting

User-Friendly Interface: Use Angular to create an intuitive and interactive user interface.
Discrepancy Visualization: Display discrepancies in a clear and organized manner.
User Interaction: Allow users to filter, sort, and analyze discrepancies.
Report Generation: Generate detailed reports of the comparison results.
Excel and PDF Export: Provide options to export reports in Excel and PDF formats.
System Maintenance and Updates

Regular Updates: Keep the system updated with the latest database drivers and security patches.
User Feedback: Collect user feedback to continuously improve the system.
